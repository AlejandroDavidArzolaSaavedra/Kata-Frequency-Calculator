This Java application provides a simple way to calculate the frequency of each value in an array. It uses the `Histogram` class to perform this calculation and the `Kata2` class as the entry point to demonstrate its functionality.

## Usage 🚀

The `Histogram` class takes a generic type `T` array in its constructor and provides a `getHistogram` method that returns a map (`Map`) mapping each unique value in the array to its corresponding frequency.
