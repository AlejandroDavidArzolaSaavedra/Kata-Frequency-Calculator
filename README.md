<h1 align="center">Kata2 - Array Value Frequency Calculator 📊</h1>

This Java application provides a simple way to calculate the frequency of each value in an array. It uses the `Histogram` class to perform this calculation and the `Kata2` class as the entry point to demonstrate its functionality.

## Usage 🚀

The application revolves around two main classes:

### Histogram 📈

The `Histogram` class takes a generic type `T` array in its constructor and provides a `getHistogram` method that returns a map (`Map`) mapping each unique value in the array to its corresponding frequency.

#### Methods 📚

- `public T[] getData()`: Returns the data array used for histogram calculation.
- `public Histogram(T[] data)`: Constructor that accepts the data array.

### Kata2 🧮

The `Kata2` class serves as the entry point for the application. In the `main` method, the usage of the `Histogram` class is illustrated with an example string array.
